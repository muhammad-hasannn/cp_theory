/*A supermarket wants to automate its checkout process by introducing a simple billing system. The cashier should be able to view a fixed list of available products along with their prices. When a customer is ready to make a purchase, the system should allow the cashier to enter the quantity of each product, after which it should calculate the total bill and apply sales tax.
To encourage more sales, the supermarket offers a discount for purchases above 500 currency units. The system should also generate a final invoice displaying item-wise details, tax, discounts, and the final amount payable.
After completing a transaction, the cashier should be able to process another customerâ€™s order without restarting the program. Features to Implement:
i. Display a fixed list of products with prices 
ii. Allow multiple item purchases and quantity input
iii. Calculate total bill with applicable tax and discounts 
iv. Print an invoice with complete details
v. Loop the program to handle multiple transactions*/
